Brief informations of datasets
Feature name is driven by gyrometer sensor attatched on study subjects living their everday life. 

---
  1. t at the beginning means that is a measurement based on the "time" domain. Measurements taken from the phone were measured at a frequency of 50Hz, meaning 50 discrete measurements per second.

  2. f at the beginning means that is a measurement based on the "frequency" domain, taken as a Fast Fourier Transform of the time-based signals.

  3. Body means that signal is based on the body of the subject, one of two components derived from the time based signals on the phone's accelerometer

  4. Gravity means that signal is based on gravity. Gravity is the second of the two measurement components derived from the phone's accelerometer.

  5. Gyro means that signal is taken from the gyroscope on the phone.

  6. Jerk means that is a measurement of sudden movement, based on body acceleration and angular velocity.

  7. Mag indicates a measurement of the magnitude of the Euclidean norm of a three-dimensional signal.

  8. X indicates that measurement was taken along the "X" dimension of the phone, as in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system of X, Y and Z.

  9. Y indicates that measurement was taken along the "Y" dimension of the phone, as in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system of X, Y and Z.

  10. Z indicates that measurement was taken along the "Z" dimension of the phone, as in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system of X, Y and Z.

  11. mean() indicates that the measurement is a mean in the original dataset

  12. std() indicates that the measurement is a standard deviation in the original dataset.
